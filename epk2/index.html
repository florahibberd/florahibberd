                           <p class="home__description">There was something peculiar about flying to Wisconsin to record Swirl for a month, after years of working together with Flora in Paris. In Eau Claire, we found ourselves immersed in Shane Leonard’s fantastic music laboratory, surrounded by outstanding musicians and friends from the neighboring Twin Cities. As a producer, Shane pushed the arrangement and parts that Flora and I had composed to a next level. During the sessions, I mainly tried to give my best at laying down guitars, and played a bit of bass and keys as well. One of my favorite things about Swirl is its overall unique character and grit. I like how it doesn’t sound clean, yet still has this satisfying clarity. The tension that it carries all along those eleven tracks kind of brings together the songs’ internal sense of danger to their purely musical, even sonic rendition. In a way, this is what songwriting is all about and I’m glad I’ve been part of an artistic project that’s so clever in every aspect. Because it is quite sober and minimalistic in the end, and that many of the takes in there were recorded live, Swirl is a risky album that not only serves Flora’s songs in a beautiful way, but demonstrates her creative magnitude.</p>
